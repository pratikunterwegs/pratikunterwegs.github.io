title = "Scientific Trajectory"
subtitle = "I have worked on a number of field and analysis focussed projects, in 5 countries, on 3 continents. My field experience includes the Arctic tundra, high-altitude desert, tropical drylands, and the North Sea intertidal. This has involved coding in `R`, `Python`, and `C++`, reproducibly wrangling spatial data, driving off-road, handling birds and mammals, and writing up papers."
