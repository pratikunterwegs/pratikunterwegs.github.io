  description = """I'm studying the causes and consequences of movement strategies in animal populations, using a combination of empirical data and mechanistic individual based simulation models.

  My PhD involves:
  
  * Handling large datasets of high-resolution tracking data from the [WATLAS](https://www.nioz.nl/en/about/cos/coastal-movement-ecology/shorebird-tracking/watlas-tracking-regional-movements) time-of-arrival tracking system. 
  * Writing and maintaining the `R` package [watlastools](https://pratikunterwegs.github.io/watlastools/) to process WATLAS data.
  * Designing and/or writing individual based simulations _Kleptomove_, _Infomove_, and _perlinWalker_ in `C++`, and analysis simulation output in `R` and `Python`.
  * Mentoring master's and bachelor's students for thesis and course-related projects, some fieldwork supporting the red knot catching team, organising departmental seminars, and representing the institute's PhD students before the Faculty Board.

  I also collaborate on occupancy modelling of montane passerines using eBird data from southern India with [Vijay Ramesh](https://evolecol.weebly.com/) and [Morgan Tingley](https://www.morgantingley.com/).
