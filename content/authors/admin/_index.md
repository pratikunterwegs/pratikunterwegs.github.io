I'm keen on bringing my skills in `R` programming and (spatial) data-wrangling to bear on clear and evident problems, rather than open-ended exploratory research.

My training and experience has been in animal movement and space-use across spatio-temporal scales. I want to help ensure that the world's many amazing and mobile species survive the current climate and biodiversity crisis.
